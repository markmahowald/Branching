## Branching notes

This will list ways to create and manage branches. 

`git branch` - list branches you have locally, and highlight the one you're using. 

`git branch BRANCH_NAME` - creates a new branch called BRANCH_NAME. 

`git chreckout BRANCH_NAME` - switches us into the branch BRANCH_NAME.

Be careful of letting master get ahead of your branch
